//Answer question "If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
//a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? ---- "Yes"(part 10)

a DVD by category since these two constructors have the same number of parameters and same types
- JAVA is a Pass By Value programming language(part 15)
