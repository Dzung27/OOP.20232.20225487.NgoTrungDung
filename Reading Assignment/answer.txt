1. Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts?
Media
2. What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
	+ Easy to add or remove information
	+ Convenience
3. How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
	+ Override
4. What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?
	+ Conceptual Difference: Inheritance is a mechanism where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass. Polymorphism, on the other hand, refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different ways.
	+ Syntax while Inheritance using superclass , Polymorphism using override
5. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
	book, digtalvideodisc, compactdisc
6. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method to reflect the ordering that 
we want?
	should return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer depending on whether the current object should be ordered before, equal to, or after the specified object.
7. Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
	No
8. Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
	Custom a different Comparator
